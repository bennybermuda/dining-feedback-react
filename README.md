Dining Feedback (ONGOING):

-A persistent, real-time chat web app meant to bridge the communications gap between students and dining hall staff regarding feedback for the dining experience.

-The idea stemmed from my experience working part time as a Dining Ambassador, whose job is to take student feedback and present them directly to dining hall staff at weekly meetings. A problem I noticed with the process was that some students were making the same requests every week (i.e. add oat milk) and staff would have the same response (i.e. we did that last Tuesday, we don't have the budget). It looked like students that submitted this feedback may not know it was responded to, and staff couldn't field as much feedback as they wanted to as a result. Thus, this project!

-The front end is built in Javascript(React), HTML, and CSS.

-The back end is built in Node, Express, Sockets, and Firebase's NoSQL database
